1.0.24: Auto-update mechanism which triggers zone status send when zone is started/closed.
        Remove incremental updates when using homekit mode. Now each update gives full status of sprinklers.
        Added initial support for larger amount of sprinklers. Currently works for up to 8 but I plan to extend that when I'll have more zones configured on my Rainbird
1.0.30: Fix for long-term connection stability (AbortError after prolonged use of connection). Not verified yet as it requires significant amount of time...       
1.0.32: Additional data in info reply
1.0.36: Modify info output to distinguish between different data types. 
        Add rain sensor reporting to info node
1.0.40: Fixed rainbird class structure. 
        Fixed rainbird class logging, debug now works properly.
        Fixed inconsistent class init for different functions.
        Add seasonal program adjust info for all programs (info node).
        Add device type decoding.
1.0.40: Added initial support of program schedule retrieval but my ESP-ME3 does not support this command so it is not fully implemented...
        Added ability to check if device supports selected command (node-rainbird module).
        Modified rainbird-state to show additional info about controller state and running program - not tested as my ESP-ME3 does not support that command
1.0.42: Added node to check which command is supported by controller.
1.0.43: Decoding time and date in info response.
